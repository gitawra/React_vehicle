        Brand Story - The spectacular rise of the Silver Arrows.
        From 1934 till date.</p>
<p>It was a debut in sparkling silver, and it ended with shining gold: 
the first race at NÃ¼rburgring with the completely newly developed Mercedes-Benz 
W25 racing car on 3 June 1934 was won by Manfred von Brauchitsch with an average 
speed of 122.5 km/h -a new track record. However, the victory was almost outshone 
by the sensational fact that the new Mercedes-Benz racing car took to the track with
 its aluminium body in shining silver rather than with the classic paint finish in 
 racing white. According to the legend, the metallic silver skin was only exposed 
 during the night before the race, by grinding off the white paint to bring the 
 starting weight of the W 25 down to the limit prescribed by the race rules. 
 In subsequent years, this first appearance by a Mercedes-Benz Silver Arrows 
 founded a glorious tradition of great motor racing victories with racing cars
  and racing sports cars that continues to this day.</p>
  <p>Where do you take luxury to, 
  when you are the Benchmark? Our Journey to the Next, found Inspiration in the Past.
   To a legendary race where Mercedes shaved off the paint on their Cars to meet 
   weight requirement. The World called those metals streaks Silver Arrows, it's 
   our name today. And that Passion to win keep us going further every day.PASSION. 
   That thing you do because you love to. It's our Motto, it's what we work with, 
   it's what we live by, it's what sharpens our skill, it's what makes our Aim true. 
   Because what we are looking for is the path to ever highest standards of Service 
   excellence. And Passion is the only way! Silver Arrows, Passion Points the Way.
